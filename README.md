# Overview
This tool is just something I wanted to make so some of the lower-level Smite leagues could still create good content for everyone to see. It at least makes the stream look more professional when you have a good-looking pick/ban layout. With the way that resources are used in this application, I’ve tried to leave as much creativity open to you as possible. Almost everything shown in the display window can be changed visually, the only thing locked is the locations of the picks/bans. If you’d like, you can even make every element of the screen transparent except for the picks/bans and create an entirely different looking layout just using the picks/bans from the application. I’ve put way too much work into this thing just for me to only give it to the league I’m in, so please enjoy!
